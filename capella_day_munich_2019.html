				<h3 id="talk_thales">Augmenting requirements with models to improve the articulation between system
					engineering levels and optimize V&V practices</h3>
				<p>Model-based systems engineering has developed significantly over the last few years, resulting in an
					increased usage of models in systems specification and architecture description. The question of the
					positioning of requirement engineering versus MBSE is a recurrent one.</p>
				<p>This talk describes one vision of this articulation where textual and model requirements actually
					complete each other. The results are improved contracts across engineering levels and more
					formalized V&V practices.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_siemens_ct">Model-based safety analysis on Capella using Component Fault Trees (CFTs)</h3>
				<p>The importance of mission or safety-critical software systems in many application domains of embedded
					systems is continuously growing, and so is the effort and complexity for reliability and safety
					analysis. Model-based system engineering (MBSE) is currently one of the key approaches to cope with
					increasing system complexity.</p>
				<p>With Component Fault Trees (CFTs) there is a model- and component-based methodology for safety
					analysis, which extends the advantages of model-based development to safety & reliability
					engineering. In this talk, we demonstrate how to ease the development of safety-critical systems in
					industrial practice by extending MBSE in Capella with model-based safety analysis using Component
					Fault Tree methodology.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_maplesoft">An Excel-based Systems-Engineering Tool for Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration
					across the Enterprise</h3>
				<p>MapleMBSE is an Excel-based tool that makes it easy for every stakeholder to engage with the Systems
					Engineering project without requiring them to be an expert in your primary SE tools.<br />
					MapleMBSE makes broad engagement possible with Excel-based, task-specific interfaces for each
					activity in the systems design process.<br />
					By giving all stakeholders access to the process through a live, two-way connection to systems
					model, you can ensure that all stakeholders can collaborate through the “single source of truth”,
					allowing them to work faster, avoid errors, and reduce unbudgeted costs.<br />
					This presentation will demonstrate how MapleMBSE can be used for several use-cases on the Capella
					platform, based on Maplesoft’s experience with NASA JPL in the US and Nissan in Japan.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_artal">Providing early timing analysis of the system design</h3>
				<p>When designing real-time systems, one issue is to grant that the system will always behave properly
					within the expected time constraints.<br />
					By capturing the design choices in Capella (periodic/sporadic events, precedence relation between
					tasks, network communication between resources, mutual exclusion resources, etc.), Tideal viewpoint
					not only allows to compute the worst-case execution time for end-to-end flows traversing the system
					but also provides some feedback to the architect to better understand the temporal behavior of the
					system.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_obeo">Integrating Capella with your own ecosystem of tools</h3>
				<p>The current industrial trends related, among others, to digital twins or large scale systems of
					systems, drive companies to using MBSE tools such as Capella. However, these tools have to be part
					of the overall ecosystem of tools used by such companies (e.g. complex systems manufacturers).</p>
				<p>One example is the integration with a PLM solution, that we will illustrate by explaining how we have
					integrated Capella and Teamcenter by developping System Modeling Workbench.</p>
				<p>Beyond technical aspects (build the product, managing its lifecycle with regards to constraints
					brought by the market and by the open source processes, etc.) we will also discuss the organization
					of the collaboration needed to perform this kind of integration project.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_glaway">Model Execution and System Simulation in Capella</h3>
				<p>A common need in system architecture design is to verify that if the architect is correct and can
					satisfy its requirements. Execution of system architect model means to interact with state machines
					to test system’s control logic. It can verify if the logical sequences of functions and interfaces
					in different scenarios are desired.</p>
				<p>However, only sequence itself is not enough to verify its consequence or output. So we need each
					function to do what it is supposed to do during model execution to verify its output, and that is
					what we called “system simulation”.</p>
				<p>This presentation introduces how we do model execution in Capella, and how to embed digital mockup
					inside functions to do “system simulation” with a higher confidence.</p>
