				<p>Modern systems are subjected to increasingly higher
					constraints regarding safety, security, performance, environment,
					human factors, etc. Each of these constraints are under the
					responsibility of different stakeholders which deeply influences
					the systems architectural design and development process. They are
					to be integrated and reconciled.</p>
				<h3>Architecture as prime engineering driver</h3>
				<p>Architecture is a powerful tool to analyse operational needs,
					to structure and to break down the system, software, or hardware
					function in order to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide significant information for decision-makers and
						managers</li>
					<li>Ease the mastering of need, complexity, design and
						development</li>
					<li>Structure engineering in a well-defined, justified,
						technical frame</li>
					<li>Guide designers and developers to respect the product
						definition drivers</li>
				</ul>

				<p></p>
				<h3>Arcadia, a model-based engineering method</h3>
				<p>
				</p><p>
					Arcadia is a <b>model-based engineering method for systems,
						hardware and software architectural design</b>. It has been developed
					by Thales between 2005 and 2010 through an iterative process
					involving operational architects from all the Thales business
					domains.
				</p>
				<p>Arcadia promotes a viewpoint-driven approach (as described in
					ISO/IEC 42010) and emphasizes a clear distinction between need and
					solution.</p>

				<a rel="gallery" class="fancybox" href="images/arcadia/triptique.png"><img class="center" alt="Triptique" src="images/arcadia/triptique.png" width="50%"></a> <br> <br>

				<p>Steps and activities of the method have been defined with a
					few Golden Rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Besides requirement engineering, drive an <b>operational
							need analysis</b>, describing final user expectations, usage
						conditions, and realistic IVVQ conditions
					</li>
					<li>Consider engineering through three mandatory interrelated
						activities, at the same level of importance:
						<ul>
							<li>Need analysis and modelling</li>
							<li>Architecture building and validation</li>
							<li>Requirements engineering</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Check requirements against an <b>architectural design
							model</b> (early architecture) for robustness and feasibility
					</li>
					<li>Structure the system/hardware/software and build a <b>logical
							architecture</b>, by searching for the best <b>compromise between
							design drivers, (non-functional) constraints and viewpoints</b>. Each
						viewpoint deals with a specific concern such as functional
						consistency, interfaces, performances, real time, safety,
						security, integration, reuse, cost, risk, schedule, and the ease
						of adaptation (e.g. to changing requirements)
					</li>
					<li>Secure development and IVVQ through a <b>physical
							architecture</b> which deals with technical and development issues,
						favouring separation of concerns, efficient and safe component
						interaction (e.g. layered architecture, generic behaviour and
						interaction patterns, component model, etc.)
					</li>
				</ul>

								<h3>Noticeable features of Arcadia</h3> <br>

								<ul>
									<li>Models supporting enterprise-wide collaboration
											and co-engineering
										<ul>
											<li>A Capella model is built for each Arcadia
												engineering phase. All of these models are related by
												justification links and are processed as a whole for impact
												analysis.</li>
											<li>Collaboration with engineering specialities is
												supported by modelled engineering viewpoints to formalise
												constraints and to evaluate architecture adequacy with each
												of them</li>
											<li>Collaboration with customer and subsystems
												engineering relies on co-engineered models (e.g. physical
												architecture), automatic initialisation of need model for
												sub-systems, and impact analysis means between requirements
												and models of different engineering levels.</li>
										</ul></li>
									<li>Tailored for architectural design
										<ul>
											<li>A domain-specific language (DSL) was preferred in
												order to ease appropriation by all stakeholders, usually not
												familiar with general-purpose, generic languages such as UML
												or SysML.</li>
										</ul></li>
									<li>Dealing with complexity and size
										<ul>
											<li>Abstraction levels are in the DNA of Arcadia.
												Capella advanced mechanisms have been developed to mask and
												confine complexity, deal with model maintenance, large-scale
												modelling, model evolution and reuse.</li>
										</ul></li>
									<li>Field-proven in real industrial situations
										<ul>
											<li>Arcadia is currently applied in most Thales business
												units, in many countries, on very large or small projects,
												by hundreds of users. A continuous challenging, improvement
												and adaptation of both the method and its supporting
												workbench has favoured a very fast dissemination.</li>
										</ul></li>
									<li>Open to domain-specific added value</li>
									<li>Adapted to several lifecycles and work sharing
											schemes</li>
								</ul>

				<h3>Definition of the Problem - Customer Operational Need
					Analysis</h3>
				<p>
					The first step focuses on analysing the customer needs and goals,
					expected missions and activities, far beyond system requirements.
					This analysis aims at ensuring <b>adequate system definition
						with regard to its real operational use and IVVQ conditions</b>.
				</p>
				<p>Outputs of this engineering phase mainly consist of an
					“operational architecture” which describes and structures the need
					in terms of actors/users, their operational capabilities and
					activities (including operational use scenarios with dimensioning
					parameters, and operational constraints such as safety, security,
					lifecycle, etc.).</p>
				<h3>Formalization of system requirements - System Need Analysis</h3>
				<p>
					The second step focuses on the <b>system itself</b>, in order to
					define <b>how it can satisfy the former operational need</b>, along
					with its expected behaviour and qualities. The following elements
					are created during this step: Functions to be supported and related
					exchanges, non-functional constraints (safety, security, etc.),
					performance allocated to system boundary, role sharing and
					interactions between system and operators, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main goal at this stage is to <b>check the feasibility of
						customer requirements</b> (cost, schedule, technology readiness, etc.)
					and if necessary, to provide means to renegotiate their content.
					The functional need analysis can be completed by an initial system
					architectural design model in order to examine requirements against
					this architecture and evaluate their cost and consistency.
				</p>
				<p>Outputs of this engineering phase mainly consist of system
					functional need descriptions (functions, functional chains,
					scenarios), interoperability and interaction with the users and
					external systems (functions, exchanges plus non-functional
					constraints), and system requirements.</p>
				<p>
					Note that these two phases, which constitute the first part of
					architecture building, <b>"specify" the subsequent design</b>, and
					therefore should be approved/validated with the Customer.
				</p>
				<h3>Development of System Architectural Design - Logical
					Architecture (Notional Solution)</h3>
				<p>
					This third step aims at building a <b>coarse-grained component
						breakdown of the system</b> which is unlikely to be challenged later
					in the development process. Starting from previous functional and
					non-functional analysis refined results (functions, interfaces,
					data flows, behaviours…), build one or several decompositions of
					the system into logical components. These logical components will
					later tend to be the basic decomposition for
					development/sub-contracting, integration, reuse, product and
					configuration management item definitions (but other criteria will
					be taken into account to define the boundaries for these items)
				</p>

				<a rel="gallery" class="fancybox" href="images/arcadia/composant-functions.png"><img class="center" alt="Functions" src="images/arcadia/composant-functions.png" width="50%"></a> <br>
				<br>

				<p>
					The building process has to take into account <b>architectural
						drivers and priorities, viewpoints and associated design rules</b>,
					etc. For te component breakdown to be stable in further engineering
					phases, all major (non-functional) constraints (safety, security,
					performance, IVV, cost, non-technical, Etc.) are taken into account
					and compared to each other so as to find the best trade-off. This
					method is described as "viewpoint-driven", where viewpoints
					formalise the way these constraints impact the system architecture.
				</p>
				<p>Outputs of this engineering phase consist of the selected
					logical architecture which is described by components and justified
					interfaces definition, scenarios, modes and states, formalisation
					of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the
					components design.</p>
				<p>Since the architecture has to be validated against the need
					analysis, links with requirements and operational scenarios are
					also to be produced.</p>

				<a rel="gallery" class="fancybox" href="images/arcadia/arcadia_viewpoints.png"><img class="center" alt="Viewpoints" src="images/arcadia/arcadia_viewpoints.png" width="50%"></a> <br>
				<br>

				<h3>Development of System Architecture - Physical Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					The fourth step has the same intent as the logical architecture
					building, except that it defines the “final” architecture of the
					system at this level of engineering. Once this is done the model is
					considered <b>ready to develop</b> (by "lower" engineering levels).
					Therefore, it introduces rationalisation, architectural patterns,
					new technical services and components, and makes the logical
					architecture evolve according to implementation, technical and
					technological constraints and choices. The same viewpoint-driven
					approach as for logical architecture building is used.
				</p>
				<p>Outputs of this engineering phase consist of the selected
					physical architecture which includes components to be produced,
					formalisation of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into
					account in the components design. Links with requirements and
					operational scenarios are also produced.</p>
				<h3>Formalize Components Requirements - Contracts for
					Development and IVVQ</h3>
				<p>The fifth and last step is a contribution to an EPBS
					(End-Product Breakdown Structure), taking benefits from the former
					architectural work, to formalise the component requirements
					definition and prepare a secured IVVQ.</p>
				<p>All previous hypotheses and imposed constraints associated to
					the system architecture and components are summarised and checked
					here.</p>
				<p>
					Outputs from this engineering phase are mainly <b>component
						integration contracts</b> collecting all necessary expected properties
					for each component to be developed.
				</p>
				<h3>Co-Engineering, Sub-Contracting and Multi-Level Engineering</h3>
				<p>
					The physical architecture is the preferred place for <b>co-engineering
						between systems, software, and hardware stakeholders</b>.
				</p>

				<a rel="gallery" class="fancybox" href="images/arcadia/coengineering-and-subcontracting.png"><img class="center" alt="Coengineering" src="images/arcadia/coengineering-and-subcontracting.png" width="50%"></a> <br> <br>

				<p>
					Arcadia can be applied in a <b>recursive way at each level of
						system breakdown</b>, so that a subsystem of the current system of
					interest becomes the system at the next level of interest, until
					single discipline subsystems or procurement items or COTS are
					identified.
				</p>
				<p>The physical architecture at a given level of interest
					defines the components to be developed at the level above,
					according to the corresponding component integration contract.
					Level "n" need analysis is restricted to each component scope, in
					order to define its IVVQ context.</p>


				<a rel="gallery" class="fancybox" href="images/arcadia/multi-level.png"><img class="center" alt="Multi-level" src="images/arcadia/multi-level.png" width="50%" /></a> <br> <br>


				<h3>Adaptation of Arcadia to Dedicated Domains, Contexts, Etc.</h3>
				<p>
					Beyond the transverse, common architectural design work, each
					organization, in the field of its own business, constraints and
					know-how, should <b>tailor the method steps by adapting them to
						their own domains, products and programs</b>. This includes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Definition of a reference architecture (including
						architecture drivers) for each key product and software element</li>
					<li>Definition of appropriate viewpoints adapted to the
						domain, product and architecture</li>
					<li>Definition of complementary dedicated engineering rules</li>
					<li>Selection of relevant architectural patterns for the
						domain, product, and technologies considered</li>
					<li>Setting up of models, based on the reference architecture
						and viewpoints, and basis for simulation, early validation,
						automation of the design process (key for productivity gains)</li>
					<li>Definition of adjustment rules for each of its contexts</li>
					<li>Dissemination in the engineering teams (training,
						coaching)...</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The recommended method described in this document takes best
					benefit from a <b>top-down approach</b>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Starting from operational need to define and validate
						requirements</li>
					<li>Building a "technology neutral" logical architecture
						dealing with non-functional constraints</li>
					<li>Then specifying technical functions and services of a
						physical architecture to implement it in the best way</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Yet many constraints which need to be taken into account
					arise from the industrial context:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Technical or technological limits</li>
					<li>Available technology, COTS</li>
					<li>Existing legacy to be reused</li>
					<li>Product policy imposing the use of given hardware boards,
						software components...</li>
					<li>Industrial constraints such as available skills, the
						necessity to sub-contract, and export control...</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This is the reason why Arcadia can be applied according to several
					lifecycles and work sharing schemes. Great care has been taken in
					the method, language and the Capella workbench to not impose one
					single engineering path (e.g. top-down) but to be adaptable to many
					lifecycles: <b>Incremental, iterative, top-down, bottom-up,
						middle-out</b>, Etc.. The method is inherently <b>iterative</b>.
				</p>
				<p>Examples of iterations or non-linear courses are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Need analysis starting from requirements, due to a lack of
						operational knowledge (a kind of reverse engineering of
						operational need)</li>
					<li>Requirements analysis anticipating logical or even
						physical architecture, to check for feasibility by
						defining/confronting to an early architecture</li>
					<li>Logical architecture anticipating (part of) physical
						architecture, e.g. to check for performance issues</li>
					<li>Physical architecture adapting to subcontracting
						constraints</li>
					<li>Components contract definition iterating on physical
						architecture to secure integration and refine contract parameters</li>
				</ul>
