					Current systems are submitted to high constraints regarding safety, security, performance, environment, human factors, Etc. 
					All of these constraints under the responsibility of different stakeholders deeply influence systems architectural design and 
					development. They are to be integrated and reconciled.
				</p>
				<h3>Architecture as prime engineering driver</h3>
				<p>
					Architecture is a powerful tool to analyse operational need, structure and break down the
					system, software, or hardware function in order to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide significant information for decision-makers and managers</li>
					<li>Ease mastering of need, complexity, design and development</li>
					<li>Structure engineering in a well-defined, justified, technical frame</li>
					<li>Guide designers and developers so as to respect product definition drivers</li>
				</ul>
				
				<img class="center" alt="Architecture benefits" src="images/arcadia/architecture_benefits.png" width="80%">
				
				<br />
				<br />
				</p>
				<h3>Arcadia, a model-based engineering method</h3>
				<p>				
				<p>
					Arcadia is a <b>model-based engineering method for systems, hardware and software architectural design</b>. 
					It has been developed in Thales between 2005 and 2010 through an iterative process involving operational 
					architects from all Thales domains.
				</p>
				<p>
					Arcadia promotes a viewpoint-driven approach (as described in ISO/IEC 42010 standard) and emphasizes a clear 
					distinction between need and solution.
				</p>
				
				
				<img class="center" alt="Triptique" src="images/arcadia/triptique.png" width="70%">
				
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<p>
					Steps and activities of the method have been defined with a few Golden Rules:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Besides requirement engineering, drive an <b>operational need analysis</b>, describing final user expectations,  
						usage conditions, and realistic IVVQ conditions</li>
					<li>Consider engineering through three mandatory interrelated activities, at the same level of importance:</li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li><b>Need analysis and modelling</b></li>
						<li><b>Architecture building and validation</b></li>
						<li><b>Requirements engineering</b></li>
					</ol>
					<li>Check requirements against an <b>architectural design model</b> (early architecture) for robustness and feasibility</li>
					<li>Structure system/hardware/software and build a <b>logical architecture</b>, by searching for best <b>compromise between design 
						drivers, (non-functional) constraints and viewpoints</b>. Each viewpoint deals with a specific concern such as functional 
						consistency, interfaces, performances, real time, safety, security, integration, reuse, cost, risk, schedule, ease of 
						adaptation (e.g. to changing requirements)</li>
					<li>Ease and secure development and IVVQ through a <b>physical architecture</b> dealing with technical and development issues, 
						favouring separation of concerns, efficient and safe components interaction (e.g. layered architecture, generic behaviour 
						and interaction patterns, component model, etc.)</li>
				</ol>
				
				<img class="center" alt="Phases" src="images/arcadia/phases_arcadia.png" width="95%">
								
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<h3>Define the Problem - Customer Operational Need Analysis</h3>
				<p>
					The first step focuses on analysing the customer needs and goals, expected missions and activities, far beyond system 
					requirements. This analysis aims at ensuring a <b>good adequacy of system definition with regards to its real operational 
					use and IVVQ conditions</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outputs of this engineering phase mainly consist in an “operational architecture” describing and structuring this need, in terms of actors/users, 
					their operational capabilities and activities, operational use scenarios giving dimensioning parameters, operational constraints 
					including safety, security, lifecycle, etc.
				</p>
				<h3>Formalization of system requirements - System Need Analysis</h3>
				<p>
					The second step focuses on the <b>system itself</b>, in order to define <b>how it can satisfy the former operational need</b>, along with its 
					expected behaviour and qualities: Functions to be supported and related exchanges, non-functional constraints (safety, security, etc.), 
					performance allocated to system boundary, role sharing and interactions between system and operators, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal at this stage is also to <b>check the feasibility of customer requirements</b> (cost, schedule, technology readiness, etc.) 
					and if necessary, to provide means to renegotiate their contents. This functional need analysis can be completed by a first 
					early system architectural design model in order to examine requirements against this architecture and evaluate their cost 
					and consistency.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outputs of this engineering phase mainly consist of system functional need description (functions, functional chains, scenarios), interoperability and 
					interaction with the users and external systems (functions, exchanges plus non-functional constraints), and system requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that these two phases, which constitute the first part of architecture building, <b>"specify" the subsequent design</b>, 
					and therefore should be approved/validated with the Customer.
				</p>
				<h3>Development of System Architectural Design - Logical Architecture (Notional Solution)</h3>
				<p>
					This third step aims at building a <b>coarse-grained breakdown of the system in components</b> not likely to be challenged later 
					in the development. Starting from previous functional and non-functional analysis refined results (functions, interfaces, 
					data flows, behaviours…), build one or several decompositions of the system into logical components. These logical components 
					will later tend to be the basic decomposition for development/sub-contracting, integration, reuse, product and configuration 
					management item definitions (but other criteria will be taken into account to define the boundaries for these items)
				</p>
				
				<img class="center" alt="Functions" src="images/arcadia/composant-functions.png" width="60%">
								
				<br />
				<br />
				
				
				<p>
					The building process has to take into account <b>architecture drivers and priorities, viewpoints and associated design rules</b>, 
					etc. For this breakdown in components to be stable in further engineering phases, all major (non-functional) constraints 
					(safety, security, performance, IVV, cost, non-technical, Etc.) are taken into account and compared to each other so as to find 
					the best compromise between them. This method is described as "viewpoint-driven", viewpoints being the formalisation of 
					the way these constraints impact the system architecture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outputs of this engineering phase consist of the selected logical architecture: Components and justified 
					interfaces definition, scenarios, modes and states, formalisation of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the components design. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the architecture has to be validated against the need analysis, links with requirements and operational scenarios are also to be produced.
				</p>
				
				<img class="center" alt="Viewpoints" src="images/arcadia/arcadia_viewpoints.png" width="90%">
								
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<h3>Development of System Architecture - Physical Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					The fourth step has the same intents as logical architecture building, except that it defines the “final” architecture of the system 
					at this level of engineering, <b>ready to develop</b> (by "lower" engineering levels). Therefore, it introduces rationalisation, architectural 
					patterns, new technical services and components, and makes the logical architecture evolve according to implementation, technical and 
					technological constraints and choices. The same viewpoint-driven approach as for logical architecture building is used.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outputs of this engineering phase consist of the selected physical architecture: Components to be produced, 
					including formalisation of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the components design. Links with 
					requirements and operational scenarios are also produced.
				</p>
				<h3>Formalize Components Requirements - Contracts for Development and IVVQ</h3>
				<p>
					The fifth and last step is a contribution to EPBS (End-Product Breakdown Structure) building, taking benefits from the former 
					architectural work, to enforce components requirements definition, and prepare a secured IVVQ.
				</p>
				<p>
					All choices associated to the system chosen architecture and all hypotheses and constraints imposed to components and 
					architecture to fit need and constraints are summarised and checked here.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outputs from this engineering phase are mainly <b>component integration contracts</b> collecting all necessary 
					expected properties for each component to be developed.
				</p>
				<h3>Co-Engineering, Sub-Contracting and Multi-Level Engineering</h3>
				<p>
					The physical architecture is the preferred place for <b>co-engineering between systems, software, and hardware stakeholders</b>.
				</p>
				
				<img class="center" alt="Coengineering" src="images/arcadia/coengineering-and-subcontracting.png" width="80%">
								
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<p>
					Arcadia can be applied in a <b>recursive way at each level of system breakdown</b>, so that a subsystem of the current system of 
					interest becomes the system at the next level of interest, until single discipline subsystems or procurement items or 
					COTS are identified.
				</p>
				<p>
					The physical architecture at level n defines components to be developed at level n-1, according to the corresponding component 
					integration contract. Level "n" need analysis is restricted to each component scope, in order to define its IVVQ context.
				</p>
				
				
				<img class="center" alt="Multi-level" src="images/arcadia/multi-level.png" width="60%">
								
				<br />
				<br />
				
				
				<h3>Adaptation of Arcadia to Dedicated Domains, Contexts, Etc.</h3>
				<p>
					Beyond the transverse, common architectural design work, each organization, in the field of its own business, 
					constraints and know-how, should <b>tailor the method steps by adapting them to their own domains, 
					products and programs</b>.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Definition of a reference architecture (including architecture drivers) for each key product and software</li>
					<li>Definition of appropriate viewpoints adapted to the domain, product and architecture</li>
					<li>Definition of complementary dedicated engineering rules</li>
					<li>Selection of relevant architectural patterns for the domain, product, and technologies considered</li>
					<li>Setting up of models, based on the reference architecture and viewpoints, and basis for simulation, early validation, 
						automation of the design process (key for productivity gains)</li>
					<li>Definition of adjustment rules for each of its contexts</li>
					<li>Dissemination in the engineering teams (training, coaching)...</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The recommended method described in this document will take best benefit from a <b>top-down approach</b>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Starting from operational need to define and validate requirements</li>
					<li>Building a "technology neutral" logical architecture dealing with non-functional constraints</li>
					<li>Then specifying technical functions and services of a physical architecture to implement it in the best way</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Yet many constraints to be taken into account arise from the industrial context, such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Technical or technological limits</li>
					<li>Available technology, COTS</li>
					<li>Existing legacy to be reused</li>
					<li>Product policy imposing the use of given hardware boards, software components...</li>
					<li>Industrial constraints such as available skills, necessity to sub-contract, export control...</li>
				</ul>
				<p>					
					Arcadia can be adapted to several lifecycles and work sharing schemes. Great care has been taken in the method, 
					the language and the workbench not to impose one single engineering path (e.g. top-down) but to be adaptable to 
					many lifecycles: <b>Incremental, iterative, top-down, bottom-up, middle-out</b>, Etc.. The method is inherently <b>iterative</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of iterations or non-linear courses: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Need analysis starting from requirements, due to a lack of operational knowledge 
						(a kind of reverse engineering of operational need)</li>
					<li>Requirements analysis anticipating logical or even physical architecture, to check 
						for feasibility by defining/confronting to an early architecture</li>
					<li>Logical architecture anticipating (part of) physical architecture, e.g. to check for performance issues</li>
					<li>Physical architecture adapting to subcontracting constraints</li>
					<li>Components contract definition iterating on physical architecture to secure integration and refine contract parameters</li>
				</ul>
